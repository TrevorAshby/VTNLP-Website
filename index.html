                <p id="lifu_text">I am an Assistant Professor of the <a class="inline_link" href="https://cs.vt.edu/">Computer 
                    Science Department</a> at <a>Virginia Tech</a>, 
                    where I lead the <b>Natural Language Processing Lab</b>. 
                    At VT CS, I'm also a member of 
                    the <a class="inline_link" href="https://sanghani.cs.vt.edu/">Sanghani Center 
                    for Artificial Intelligence and Discovery Analytics</a>. 
                    Prior to VT, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from UIUC where 
                    I worked with <a class="inline_link" href="http://nlp.cs.rpi.edu/hengji.html">Heng Ji</a>.
                    My research centers on Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Artificial 
                    Intelligence, with a keen interest in developing efficient models and benchmarks to 
                    foster machine intelligence at a human level. My research aims to continually acquire 
                    precise knowledge from the ever-changing, open world through large-scale weak 
                    supervision, endow machines with generalizable, robust and efficient intelligence, 
                    and significantly enhance human experience when interacting with the technologies. 
                    My recent research interests are the <b>fundamentals</b>, <b>understanding</b>, <b>enhancing</b>, and 
                    <b>forward-looking</b> of <b>Large Language Models (LLMs)</b> and <b>Vision-Language Models (VLMs)</b>, 
                    with broad downstream applications in NLP and Multimodal domains.</p>
                    <p id="outreach_text">I'm always looking for highly motivated students to work with me on broad NLP 
                    and Multimodal research. Please feel free to reach out and apply!</p>

            <h3>Natural Language Processing Lab</h3>
            <p>The NLP Lab at VT is mainly working on the fields of Natural 
                Language Processing, Multimodal Learning, and Machine Learning. 
                We are particularly interested in building efficient models and 
                benchmarks that can encourage machines to perform human-level intelligence. 
                We are grateful to NSF, DARPA, IARPA, U.S. Air Force, Amazon (AWS and Alexa AI), 
                Meta AI, Google, Intuit and Washington Post for supporting our research!</p>
